Spell-Checker
=============

This is a Java implemented Spell Checker that I created to improve my understanding of Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming.  

The program reads in a dictionary and a text file. It presents console prompts for corrections, writing the misspelled words and the corrected text file in separate files. 

Less emphasis was placed on optimisation, and multiple Data Structures were intentionally used. Prewritten code was taken from "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java" by Mark Allen Weiss. 

There are two implementations. Using different Data Structures, both basically acheive the same result. In order to run the file, you will require two text files, one that serves as a 'Dictionary' and another that is the file to be checked. Both will need to be in the same directory as the .java files.

I am still very much learning and any comments or advice will be appreciated. Thanks for checking this out!
