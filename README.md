Spell-Checker
=============

This is a Java implemented Spell Checker that I created to improve my understanding of Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming.  The program reads in a dictionary and a text file. It presents console prompts for corrections, writing the misspelled words and the corrected text file in separate files. Less emphasis was placed on optimisation, and multiple Data Structures were intentionally used. Prewritten code was taken from "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java" by Mark Allen Weiss. I am still very much learning and any comments or advice will be appreciated. Thanks for checking this out!
